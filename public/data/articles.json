They typically simmer in the background, shaped by small changes in policy and the economy that don't get much attention but end up making a big difference. That's very much what happened with the latest trade deal between India and the US. While officials from both sides were working out the specifics in meetings in Delhi and Washington and on the phone with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump, India was busy putting in place steps to make its economy stronger. These actions, which included changing labor regulations, lowering quality controls, and offering budget incentives, seem to have played a small but important influence in closing the transaction. Let's take it one step at a time and observe how these \"silent drivers\" fit into the overall picture."

He linked it to a phone chat with Modi, during which India supposedly decided to stop importing oil from Russia. In his reaction, Modi didn't say it was a \"trade deal,\" but he thanked the 1.4 billion people of India for what he called a \"wonderful announcement.\" What is it all about? A big cut in tariffs, from 25% to 18% on several Indian exports, which brought the total levies on numerous commodities down from about 50% to that lower number. This rollback undoes the high tariffs that Trump put on India last August as a \"penalty\" for India's oil trade with Russia. The duties started at 25% and eventually went up to 50%. Indian exporters are really happy about this, since they had been having trouble in areas like textiles and seafood."

At the same time that these talks were going on, India was working hard to establish a stronger, more future-focused economy. This wasn't just talk; it included real steps to fix problems that had been around for a long time in trade, industry, and global competitiveness.

Nirmala Sitharaman, the finance minister, gave a package that was meant to help companies that use a lot of labor and had been hurt by US tariffs. For example, shellfish and textiles. India's exports of fish and other aquatic goods fell by roughly 9.2% from the previous year after the tariffs went into effect. Shipments of knitted clothes also fell by 3.88%, to almost $1.7 billion. The Budget came up with some reasonable incentives to fight this. Sitharaman suggested raising the duty-free import restriction for some inputs used in processing seafood from 1% to 3% of the FOB value of the previous year's exports. That's a useful push to make exporting more possible. She also added shoe uppers to the list of inputs that can be imported without paying duties, which made the relief even bigger."

And he makes a good point. These improvements help Indian businesses compete better, especially against big players like China and Vietnam, in a world after the pandemic when supply chains are weak. The government is lowering the hurdles for small and medium-sized businesses, which are the backbone of these sectors, by lowering the cost of inputs. It's not only about helping people right away; it's also about making things last, creating jobs, and bringing in foreign money."

This was a huge change that combined 29 old laws into a simpler system. A lot of these old norms were from the 1930s and 1950s, when India's economy was very different from how it is now, when the globe was more connected. The government said it will help make industry stronger and create a \"future-ready workforce,\" all in keeping with the \"Aatmanirbhar Bharat\" (self-reliant India) goal."

American negotiators generally ask for more worker protections, more openness in regulations, and more freedom to make sure their businesses aren't at a disadvantage. India dealt with such problems head-on by updating these regulations. The new codes, for example, make it easier to hire and fire people, give gig workers social protection, and stress safety standards. This not only increases production at home, but it also shows commercial partners that India is following global standards. It is likely that these kinds of issues came up during the talks between India and the US, even if they were not directly addressed. Before a job interview, you should update your resume to show that you are flexible and professional. Some critics fear that some reforms might weaken workers' rights, while supporters say they strike a balance that makes India a better place to invest in manufacturing regions like Gujarat or Tamil Nadu."

Pezeshkian, who is known for his reformist ideas, said this on social media. He told his foreign minister to look into \"fair and equitable negotiations\" with the United States. Since last month, there have been a number of protests in Iran, and the government has used violence to put them down. People started protesting because of problems with the economy, but the protests quickly grew into demands for bigger changes. Pezeshkian had been very clear about how things were getting out of hand and had warned people that the unrest was putting the country's stability at risk. He wants to talk to the US now, which shows that he is open to using diplomacy. This might help him feel less stressed at home. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's Supreme Leader, is clearly on his side. The 86-year-old king has always been wary of dealing directly with the U.S., which he calls the \"Great Satan.\" His apparent support here is a big deal because it means that all of Iran's leaders agree."

He wants the nuclear program in Iran to be a big part of any talks that take place now. Iran says it doesn't want nuclear weapons, but its efforts to enrich uranium have made people all over the world worried. They've been cleaning uranium to a purity level of 60%, which is almost enough to make weapons. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) says that Iran is the only country that can do this without already having a nuclear weapon. After the bombing, Iran officially stopped enriching uranium, but they won't let IAEA inspectors into the facilities that were destroyed. It's hard and dangerous to check on some stocks because they are buried under debris."

A lot of people in Iran disagree about whether or not the US and Iran should talk to each other directly. Reformists think it would be good for the economy, but hard-liners think it would be a betrayal. Shamkhani said that the talks would only be about nuclear issues and that giving Russia enriched uranium, as was done in the 2015 deal, was not an option. Shamkhani said that Russia has offered to help again, but there is \"no reason\" for it right now.

This raise will cost you an extra $3 a day if you stay in a hotel room that costs $400 a night. That adds up to $21 more for a week-long trip. Some people don't think that's a lot, but when you think about families or long trips, it adds up. Hawaii, which is a chain of islands in the Pacific, can't afford to wait for the next crisis, according to officials. At the time, Green said, \"We need to build resilience now,\" and he stressed that the tax provides steady funding for long-term environmental protections. People who love the islands' natural beauty and visit them should help protect it for future generations, supporters say. Many passengers are said to be happy to help keep the beautiful beaches, green landscapes, and colorful marine life that brought them there in the first place.

A federal appeal judge stopped the fee for ships on January 1, 2026, which was a last-minute win for the cruise people. The case is still going on. That means cruise guests don't have to worry about anything for now, and the state loses about 10% of the money it was expecting to make. If CLIA wins for good, it might get a bigger exemption. This would mean that hotels and rentals would have to do more work."

Venice in Italy and Barcelona in Spain also have tourist taxes, but Hawaii's tax is only for climate resilience. Last month, Forbes called it a \"pioneering move\" and said it could set a good example for other places that have to deal with rising seas, wildfires, or bad weather. Hawaii is especially at risk because it is cut off from the rest of the world and gets almost a quarter of its income from tourism. The money raised will be used to fix coral reefs that have been damaged by warmer oceans, restore beaches that are important for the environment and the money they bring in from tourists, and make firebreaks stronger in places like Maui that are at risk. To make the islands more sustainable, we need to do more than just fix things after they happen. We also need to do things ahead of time, like setting up early warning systems or restoring habitats."

Some people don't believe it because of past scandals or wasteful spending by the government. Some people also say that this hurts middle-class travelers more than other travelers. Some of the costs may be covered by high-end resorts, but budget hotels and short-term rentals, which are popular with families and younger people, will probably pass them on to customers. A travel blogger I read online thought that the extra money could pay for a nice dinner out or a snorkeling trip for a family of four on vacation for two weeks. It's going to taxes instead. Hawaii could become too expensive for most people because of rising food and travel costs and inflation that is still hurting."

Also, Hawaii's taxes aren't as high as those in other places. Even with the rise, the total TAT is still lower than the fees tourists have to pay in some European cities."

You could say it's because of political tensions, like the fights between the Trump administration and Mexico and Canada.

It may not seem like much, but a 6% drop adds up in a business that doesn't make much money after paying for things like cast members, upkeep, and fireworks. Also, if tariffs or visa issues get worse, tensions with Mexico and Canada, two important places where tourists come from, could get worse. Every year, millions of Mexicans come to the U.S., and Canadians love going to Florida.

On a flight to Florida recently, Trump spun this tale aboard Air Force One, saying the project got sidelined by the war and nearly revived in 1902, but never came to fruition. \"For 200 years they’ve wanted to build an arch,\" he said, noting that 57 other cities around the world have them, but D.C. is missing out.

Historians like Chandra Manning from Georgetown University point out that early Washington was more concerned with basics—like finishing the Capitol or building roads that actually went somewhere—than fancy monuments. \"Washington coming into the Civil War was still this unfinished city,\" she says. No one's records show a big push for an arch back then."

It'd sit near the Arlington Memorial Bridge over the Potomac, evoking Paris's Arc de Triomphe, which honors French revolutionaries and Napoleonic soldiers. But Paris's version is only about 164 feet high; Trump's would dwarf it. He's setting up a committee to oversee it, though details on cost, funding, or approvals are fuzzy. Harrison Design, a local firm, is on board, but no groundbreaking date yet."

Space has always been tight at the White House, but there's no historical outcry for a ballroom. He's also shutting down the Kennedy Center for two years of renos, sparking artist backlash over his changes to the arts hub. The Rose Garden got a patio redo reminiscent of his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Inside the White House, he added a Walk of Fame with presidential portraits along the Colonnade, massive flagpoles on the lawns, and flashy golden touches to the Oval Office, Lincoln Bathroom, and Palm Room. He's even talked about sprucing up \"tired\" medians and grassy spots around town, and sent the National Guard to clear homeless camps."

Congress didn't approve it until 1925, and construction ran from 1926 to 1931. The National Park Service describes it as a post-Civil War symbol of North-South reunion, linking the Lincoln Memorial to Robert E. Lee's old home (now Arlington National Cemetery). The eagles—four of them at the corners—were part of that design, but nothing to do with a pre-war arch. The direction they faced even caused a stir back then: inward toward the city or outward to greet visitors?"

As Manning puts it, decorative stuff took a back seat to functional needs. The Civil War did disrupt a lot—construction halted, troops camped on the Mall—but no arch was in the works. The 1902 reference might nod to the McMillan Plan, which reimagined D.C.'s layout with grand vistas and monuments, but again, no arch."

Since then, Iran has refused IAEA inspections, refined uranium to almost weapons grade, and not sent stockpiles out."

It's like the whole system's been stress-tested to the breaking point, and a lot of folks aren't convinced it'll hold up."

They're the ones hyper-focused on politics and government, with around 4 in 10 of those 35 and older saying that's the main problem, versus only about 2 in 10 younger ones."

          "text": "This week, Spanish banking behemoth Santander made headlines when it said it would buy Webster Financial, a U.S.-based company, for $12.2 billion. Investors are excited but perhaps a little worried about the merger. Santander's stock fell, losing as much as 5% on Wednesday morning before settling down about 3.7% by mid-morning in Europe. When huge M&A news comes out, people usually get excited but also worried about how it will affect the company's strategy and the dangers involved. Ana Botin, the chairman, defended the move by stating that to really be a player on the global stage, you can't skip over the world's biggest economy. She has been adamant in keeping Santander's foot in the U.S. door even though it hasn't made much money there in years. \"To be a global player, you have to be in the United States,\" she told analysts on a teleconference. In the financial world, where size and diversity are important for getting through tough times, this notion hits home."

Botin tried to calm their fears by saying that there will be no additional \"bolt-on\" purchases for the next three years. That's banker talk for smaller add-on agreements; the Webster buy is more like a big expansion. Still, the market's first reaction was negative because some are worried that merging Webster could be difficult, especially since there are cultural differences between a Spanish multinational and a U.S. regional company. Last year, Santander's shares rose 125%, so a retreat isn't surprising, but it shows how sensitive investors are to any hint of overreach."

For Santander, it involves issuing new shares worth around 3.5 billion euros, which will make the shares that current holders own less valuable. Jefferies analysts say that the capital hit, which is about 140 basis points on Santander's core equity tier 1 ratio, is \"manageable,\" which means it won't hurt the bank's financial health too much. Santander started a 5 billion euro repurchase program on Wednesday to make things better for shareholders.

Think about how services might be interrupted or relationships might be lost during integration. But Jefferies thinks it's normal, like other bank mergers in the past. In banking, synergies are the holy grail: gaining more for your money by getting rid of duplication. But they can also come with problems like more government oversight or worse staff morale."

Santander has been in the US since the late 1990s, mostly through its Santander Consumer USA branch for auto loans and Sovereign Bank (now Santander Bank) for retail. But profits have been slow to come in: U.S. ROTE has stayed in the low teens, while group-wide it's higher. Botin thinks that being bigger will remedy that by making economies of scale in a market where bigger companies like JPMorgan and Bank of America are in charge. There are thousands of regional banks in the U.S., which makes it easy to gain ground quickly through acquisitions. Also, lending margins are better because U.S. rates are higher than European rates. But there are a lot of hazards, such regulatory problems from the Fed or CFPB, problems with cultural assimilation, and possible antitrust issues if it appears like too much concentration."

These data centers are in Europe, run by companies who are based there, and only hire workers who live in the EU. The structure protects the data protected from being changed or seen by anyone outside of Europe, which should stop the US government from doing so. Reiners says that this is a method for Europeans to choose what they want without anyone else telling them what to do. These corporations are making a wise business move because Europe is their second-largest market after the US. Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft, has made it very obvious how crucial it is to talk to each other to retain trust. He told CNN from Davos that jobs, commerce, and safety are all at stake if things become worse."

A lot of traders use moving averages, and when one crosses below another, it usually means that a long-term decline is starting. CryptoQuant says this could raise prices to between $60,000 and $70,000. If support levels break, things could get worse."

But that faith is fading as adoption slows down—big companies like Tesla briefly accepted it as payment but then backed off—and rules are getting stricter around the world.

Mike Archibald, a portfolio manager at AGF Investments in Toronto, was right on the money when he said, \"I think Anthropic came out with some plug-ins to tackle the legal space.\" It's clear that that's where Thomson Reuters makes a lot of money. The market doesn't always think about what it's going to do before it does it.He's right: the legal part makes them a lot of money, and if AI starts doing the hard work of case research or contract evaluations, why pay more for databases that people have put together?"

Since its peak last February, RELX has dropped by about half. Tuesday's drop was the worst since 1988. It's a clear sign that AI is shaking up even the most experienced people in Europe's software industry. Jonathan McMullan, an analyst at Schroders, put it best when he said, \"The selling pressure in software and data analytics is a sign of a deeper structural debate that has been sped up today by Anthropic's legal automation tool challenging established players like RELX.\" As the \"visibility premium\" from the past fades away, investors are quickly changing the prices in these areas. AI is growing so quickly that it's hard to defend long-term valuations.

Giuseppe Sersale, a fund manager at Anthilia, said, \"AI is getting better at the programming and knowledge-based services that these business models are based on.\" For a while, this has put some parts of the sector under a lot of stress.

But the market didn't care. Pinterest (down 5.6%) and Snap (down 8.4%) are two other companies that depend on ads and felt the pain. What? AI is getting really good at making content, targeting ads, and even coming up with campaigns.

Professional services thought they could use AI to improve their services and charge more for better insights. But Anthropic's plug-ins change everything. Claude Cowork is more than just a tool; it can also work as an entry-level analyst, paralegal, or marketer.

Or think of deepfakes made by AI, such fake news or changed video streams that cause confusion. Griesler's example of a pickpocket works because AI allows attackers blend in by seeming like normal users to get past protections. In response, the NFL is also employing AI on their side. They have machine learning algorithms that understand what \"normal\" traffic looks like on game day and flag anything that doesn't fit. It's like a digital game of cat and mouse, where both sides are getting better."

And for those of us watching from home or in the stands, it's a reminder that there are a lot of IT geniuses behind every large event making it happen.

For a long time, there have been rumors that Apple would make a foldable phone, but now, in early 2026, the leaks are coming in fast and thick. They show not just one gadget, but maybe two very different ways to use it. A lot of people are talking about the \"iPhone Fold,\" which is a bigger, book-style folding phone. There are even rumors of an iPhone Flip, which is a flip phone that snaps shut like the old flip phones we used to love. Samsung and Motorola have been in charge of this market for a long time, so Apple's entry could completely change the game. But let's take a look at what we do know right now, according to the latest news."

People are paying attention to this leaker because they have a history of leaking Apple products. They say that almost all of the specifications and design choices for this item are now public, or at least what Apple is testing. What's the big news? This test isn't going to be half-hearted. People say that this iPhone has the biggest battery Apple has ever put in one. That makes sense because these huge screens need a lot of power. These cells are much bigger than the ones in the newest Pro Max models, which are already pretty big. That could change the game for people who hate having to look for chargers all the time."

          "text": "One of the coolest changes that was suggested was the way the buttons are arranged. The power button is usually on the right side of iPhones, and the volume buttons are on the left. But here, the volume buttons are moving to the top right corner, which is where they are on an iPad mini. The power/sleep button stays on the right side, so everything else ends up on the left side. You won't have to stretch your thumb uncomfortably across a wide-open screen to change the volume anymore. It sounds simple, but it's actually very advanced engineering. By keeping the left edge completely clean, with no buttons or ports in the way, Apple can make room for that big battery and maybe even give the display a little more breathing room without having to run extra wires through the hinge area. The hinge is usually the weakest part of foldable devices, so making the inside easier to use could mean fewer problems in the long run. Apple loves to do this kind of careful redesign: get rid of old habits and replace them with new ones that work better in real life."

The whole module is jet black, no matter what color the phone is. This makes it look smooth and even, and it fits in well. The leaked designs always show that black camera bump, so it makes sense. The Dynamic Island on the front will be smaller than what we're used to seeing on slab iPhones. It seems that Apple is changing how the notch and pill work when the screen opens and closes. The goal is to make the changes easier and less distracting. White is one color that has been confirmed. There are also rumors of a second color, maybe black or something dark to go with the camera island. Foldable phones don't have the bright colors that regular iPhones do because they are usually more subtle."

This would compete with Motorola's Razr and Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip, which are small flip phones that fold in half vertically and fit in your pocket like no other. When it's closed, the goal is to make it smaller and more square. The outside screen should be good enough to let you quickly check notifications, texts, or even basic controls without having to open the whole device. When you open it, the inside screen gets bigger, making it easier to work or watch videos."

It's a good idea; foldables are still a small market, and rushing out a second model could make things less clear. People who miss how small the original iPhone Mini was but want new features would probably like the Flip. Think about how well iOS would work with your other Apple devices, such as your Mac, AirPods, or Watch. Apps that work perfectly in both folded and unfolded modes, and multitasking that feels natural. It might get people who didn't buy foldables because Samsung's software was hard to use or the hinge looked cheap."
